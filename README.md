# Game Boy Tile Painter

This is a simple program to paint 2-bit 8 by 8 Game Boy Sprites.

This code is based of a hobby project I did a while ago.
My python skills have improved a lot since then, 
so there is quite a bit of refactoring and commenting that needs doing.




## To Do
- [x] Import old code
- [x] Refactor old code

- [x] Comment old code
- [ ] separate functions into files
- [ ] create classes
- [ ] Rewrite doc strings

- [ ] Fix the functionality of the existing features
- [ ] Decide on new features and update this To Do list

- [ ] Finalize ui
